# TAKAX-Presentacion


Project Goal
To provide an efficient and accessible service through a system that connects people and businesses with recycling centers. This will facilitate the proper disposal of waste materials like plastic, paper, and cardboard, while also promoting waste reduction, environmental awareness, and the creation of sustainable economic value for the community.

Project Description
TAKAX is a social and technological project focused on promoting recycling and environmental sustainability. It uses a digital system to act as a bridge, connecting waste generators—including businesses, stores, and private individuals—with authorized recycling centers in the region.

The main purpose of the platform is to improve and simplify the entire recycling process. By centralizing everything into one accessible and user-friendly platform, we aim to encourage more efficient, transparent, and sustainable waste management.

Mission
Our mission is to make it easy for businesses to connect with recycling centers by offering an accessible system that helps them quickly find where to drop off their waste materials, such as plastic, paper, and cardboard. We aim to encourage waste reduction, create economic value from recycling, and foster a culture of environmental sustainability and social responsibility within the community.

Vision
To become a leading system for promoting a sustainable society in the Atlixco community and its surrounding regions. We will do this by efficiently connecting businesses with recycling centers and fostering a culture of environmental responsibility. We aspire to transform waste management and consumption habits, generating economic value and contributing to the care of our planet for future generations.
